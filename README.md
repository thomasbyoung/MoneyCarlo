**Monte Carlo Simulation for Hypothetical Make America Great Again Fund**

Investment Philosophy
With the election of President Trump and the new Trump administration priorities, we think that this is an opportunity to create the Make America Great Again Mutual Fund. This fund will focus on asset classes that the new administration has indicated where it wants to prioritize. The fund is composed of 14 US Equities. The fund portfolio will be a combination of existing mutual funds and mid to large cap stocks. This will be an Active managed fund with its primary focus on beating benchmarks such as the S&P 500.

The Trump administration has indicated focusing on 1) Tariffs, 2) Deregulation, 3) Oil & Gas, 4) Steel, 5) Aerospace & Defense, 6) Cryptocurrency, and 7) Immigration. Additionally, one of Trump’s key advisors is Elon Musk who generates most of his wealth from Tesla. To balance the portfolio, the portfolio will also include funds from across several industries - XLI (Industrial Sector), XLV (Health Care Sector), XLK (Technology Sector), XLF (Financial Services), and XLE (Energy Sector). The companies large and mid cap stock companies picked for Trump priorities are: 1) Berkshire Hathaway B, 2) Wells Fargo, 3) Oneok, 4) Nucor, 5) Huntington Ingalls, 6) Microstrategy, 7) Exxon Mobil, 8) Tesla, and 9 Geo Group.

The management team of this fund was able to raise $1M in its first round. The $1M will be the starting point of the fund and the equities will be distributed evenly. The goal of this fund is to maximize returns with the lowest risk assets that align with the new administration priorities.

Portfolio Holdings

Berkshire Hathaway B (BRK-B) - With the threat of tariffs, that will likely also increase the costs of homes, automobiles, and boats. Because of that increase, insurance companies should also see increased revenue from the uptick in the values of products being insured. Economists are already projecting that Cars and Truck prices will rise from the proposed tariffs. In addition to the potential revenue increase, Berkshire Hathaway’s strong balance sheet with a record level of $680B of Investments & Cash make it an attractive company to invest in.

Wells Fargo (WFC) - Wells Fargo has had significant regulation oversight over the last few years driven by the historical scandals and investigations that came from within the company. The regulations cap that has limited its growth should be lifted in 2025 and the new administration has indicated that it would like to significantly reduce regulations. The combination of the regulation cap ending and deregulations should benefit Wells Fargo back to growth trajectory.

Oneok (OKE) - Oneok is one of the largest midstream oil and gas companies with a market cap of $58B. The company has 50,000 miles of pipeline running from Texas to North Dakota. President Trump at a campaign rally in July 2024, has indicated that he wants to “drill, baby, drill”. This should lead to an increase in oil and gas production throughout the US.

Nucor (NUE) - With the impending steel tariffs on other countries, this should benefit US steel companies such as Nucor. Nucor has had positive free cash flow and net income over the last 4 years with the potential to turnaround its revenue decline thanks to the tariffs. Nucor is also a “Buy” to many Wall Street Analysts with some even recommending it as a “Strong Buy”. 

Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) - Huntington Ingalls is the country’s largest military shipbuilder. The new administration wants to eliminate inefficient spending throughout the government and companies like HII may be able to benefit from the reprioritization of budgets. The continued DoD strategy of shifting its attention towards the Pacific will benefit companies such as HII where ships will be more important than ever.

Microstrategy (MSTR) - Microstrategy is unique in that its core business is business software, but over the last few years, it’s also bought a significant amount of bitcoin making it the largest corporate holder of bitcoin. With the new administration looking at deregulation and potential promotion of cryptocurrency, Microstrategy has a strong upside if crypto becomes more mainstream under this administration.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) -  Similar to Oneok, the new administration’s efforts of Oil & Gas should benefit the largest US Oil company. The new administration has also just withdrawn from the Paris Accord and wants to double down on domestic oil production.

Tesla (TSLA) - Elon Musk is a special advisor to President Trump and Tesla should benefit from their close relationship. Although tariffs may increase prices for companies such as Tesla, the upside is potential deregulation from the administration and ensuring that emerging EV competitors such as BYD don’t make it to US shores.

GEO Group Inc (GEO) - GEO Group is a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) that specializes in private prison real estate holdings. With the increased focus on ICE and immigration, GEO should get a bump in their facilities for illegal immigrants before they’re deported.

Select Sector SPDR ETFs (XLV, XLK, XLI, XLF, XLE) - These funds are to help balance the portfolio in the event that the administration priorities run into road blocks with courts, lawmakers, or from donors.
